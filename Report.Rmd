# Introduction

This project is a tutorial of using multivaraite time series analysis for the 
stock market index, NIFTY 50 from NSE (National Stock Exchange) India. The 
data is obtained from 
[Nifty 50](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/nifty50-stock-market-data) 
contains price history and trading volumes of fifty stocks in India from 
2000-01-03 to 2020-09-30. 

We illustrates how to using Python, R, and Stata to apply Auto Regressive 
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) to time series data. ARIMA is able to fit 
a given non-seasonal non-stationary time series based on its lag values.

A general ARIMA model consists of three parts: the "AR" part means the variable
of interest is regressed on its lag terms, the "I" part means the differenced
values are used, and the "MA" part means the regression error is modeled as a
linear combination of error terms in the past. The purpose of using differenced
terms is to make the time series stationary for autoregression.

An ARIMA model is characterized by 3 terms: p (the order of AR term), q 
(the order of the MA term), and d (number of differencing to make time series 
stationary). Given a time series \(\{X_t\}\), an \(ARIMA(p, d, q)\) model 
can be expressed as: 
$$(1-\sum_{i=1}^p\phi_iL^i)(1-L)^dX_t=
(1+\sum_{i=1}^q\theta_iL^i)\epsilon_t + \delta$$
where \(\epsilon_t\) is the error term, \(L\) is the lag operator, i.e.
\(LX_t = X_{t-1}, \forall t>1\), \(p\) is the number of lagged terms of \(X\),
\(d\) is the number of times of differencing needed for stationarity,
\(q\) is the number of lagged forecast errors in prediction, \(\delta\)
is the interception term for the regression, and \(\theta, \phi\)'s are 
the estimated regression coefficients.

ARIMA models are fitted in order to understand the data better and forecast
future data. They are based on linear regression models. The best model can
be chosen using AIC or BIC.

# Data Description

`NIFTY 50` data consist of 50 stocks, 230104 observations on 15 variables. 
The data contains daily open, close, highest and lowest prices, volume and 
other relevant information for the "Nifty Fifty" stocks since January 2000. 
Detailed variable descriptions are shown in Table 1 below.

```{r description, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr, quietly = TRUE)
# variable description
var_names = names(nifty)
var_names[16] = "Return"
t = data.frame(name = var_names, 
               description = 
                c("Date of trade", "Name of the company",
                  "We have only one series: Equity(EQ)",
                  "Previous day's close price", "Open price of day",
                  "Highest price in day", "Lowest price in day",
                  "Last traded price in day", "Close price of day",
                  "Volume Weighted Average Price",
                  "A measure of sellers versus buyers of a particular stock",
                  "The number of shares available for sale",
                  "The number of shares traded", 
                  "Shares which are actually transferred among demat accounts",
                  "Percent of deliverble volume",
                  "Return of trade"))
```

As we are more interested in the stock prices, we use the variable
<code>VWAP</code> for the most part. It can summarize the average price of the
stock on a trading day. We want to catch the trend of stock prices across the
years and possibly forecast future stock prices. We take the first 5 stocks
(alphabetically) as an example in the analysis.

# Data Cleaning {.tabset .tabset-pills}

## Python

Firstly, we import the data.

```{python import}
import sys
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages')
# Just to make sure the packages are loaded.
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
df = pd.read_csv('./NIFTY50_all.csv')
```

The variable <code>Trades</code> has 50\% missing values, we can delete it.
We can delete redundant variables and impute <code>\%Deliverable</code> via
Simple Imputation because there are not so many missing values (about 7\%).

We also need to merge different symbols for the same stock. Notice that there
are many stocks that have changed names during the time period. So we should
change the old names to the new names.

```{python cleaning}
from datetime import datetime # Dealing with date format data
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer # Impute data
# Drop redundant variables and variables with too many missing values
df['Date'] = [datetime.strptime(x, '%Y-%m-%d') for x in df['Date']]
df1 = df.drop(['Trades', 'Deliverable Volume', 'Series'], axis=1)
# Merge symbols referring to the same stock
ls1 = ['MUNDRAPORT', 'UTIBANK', 'BAJAUTOFIN', 'BHARTI', 'HEROHONDA',
       'HINDALC0', 'HINDLEVER', 'INFOSYSTCH', 'JSWSTL', 'KOTAKMAH', 'TELCO',
       'TISCO', 'UNIPHOS', 'SESAGOA', 'SSLT', 'ZEETELE']
ls2 = ['ADANIPORTS', 'AXISBANK', 'BAJFINANCE', 'BHARTIARTL', 'HEROMOTOCO',
       'HINDALCO', 'HINDUNILVR', 'INFY', 'JSWSTEEL', 'KOTAKBANK', 'TATAMOTORS',
       'TATASTEEL', 'UPL', 'VEDL', 'VEDL', 'ZEEL']
df1['Symbol'] = df1['Symbol'].replace(ls1, ls2)
df1['Symbol'] = pd.Categorical(df1['Symbol'])
# Impute missing values
df2 = pd.get_dummies(data=df1, drop_first=True)
df2['Date']=df2['Date'].map(datetime.toordinal)
imp = SimpleImputer()
p = imp.fit_transform(df2)
df1['%Deliverble'] = p[:, 10]
```

## R

Before conducting core analysis, let's clean our data and check basic 
data structure.

```{r check_na}
colnames(nifty)[colSums(is.na(nifty)) > 0]
```

As we can see, variables `Trade`, `Deliverable Volume`, and `%Deliverable`
has missing values and we need to convert them to 0. Besides, we found 
out that there are stocks that changed its names during 2000 to 
2020 period, so we need to bring their names into accord.

```{r clean_data}
# change old stock names to new
old_name = c('MUNDRAPORT', 'UTIBANK', 'BAJAUTOFIN', 'BHARTI', 'HEROHONDA',
       'HINDALC0', 'HINDLEVER', 'INFOSYSTCH', 'JSWSTL', 'KOTAKMAH', 'TELCO',
       'TISCO', 'UNIPHOS', 'SESAGOA', 'SSLT', 'ZEETELE')
new_name = c('ADANIPORTS', 'AXISBANK', 'BAJFINANCE', 'BHARTIARTL', 'HEROMOTOCO',
       'HINDALCO', 'HINDUNILVR', 'INFY', 'JSWSTEEL', 'KOTAKBANK', 'TATAMOTORS',
       'TATASTEEL', 'UPL', 'VEDL', 'VEDL', 'ZEEL')

nifty$Symbol = plyr::mapvalues(nifty$Symbol, from = old_name, to = new_name)

# summary statistics of variable of interest
nifty_clean = nifty %>%
  replace(is.na(.), 0) %>% 
  mutate(Return = Close - `Prev Close`) %>% 
  select(Date, Symbol, VWAP, Volume, Turnover, Return)
summary(nifty_clean)
```


## Stata

We import the data and do some data cleaning. We drop the variable 
<code>\Trades</code> and <code>\%Deliverable</code>. Also, we transform the
<code>\Date</code> variable from string type to date type to treat the whole
data set as time series data set.

```{stata import_cleaning_stata, eval=FALSE}
import delimited NIFTY50_all.csv, clear

* Data Cleaning
gen date2 = date(date, "YMD")
format date2 %tdCCYY-nn-dd
drop date series
drop trades deliverablevolume
rename date2 date
label variable date "Date"

* Replace Symbol Names
replace symbol = "ADANIPORTS" if symbol == "MUNDRAPORT"
replace symbol = "AXISBANK" if symbol == "UTIBANK"
replace symbol = "BAJFINANCE" if symbol == "BAJAUTOFIN"
replace symbol = "BHARTIARTL" if symbol == "BHARTI"
replace symbol = "HEROMOTOCO" if symbol == "HEROHONDA"
replace symbol = "HINDALCO" if symbol == "HINDALC0"
replace symbol = "HINDUNILVR" if symbol == "HINDLEVER"
replace symbol = "INFY" if symbol == "INFOSYSTCH"
replace symbol = "JSWSTEEL" if symbol == "JSWSTL"
replace symbol = "KOTAKBANK" if symbol == "KOTAKMAH"
replace symbol = "TATAMOTORS" if symbol == "TELCO"
replace symbol = "TATASTEEL" if symbol == "TISCO"
replace symbol = "UPL" if symbol == "UNIPHOS"
replace symbol = "VEDL" if symbol == "SESAGOA"
replace symbol = "VEDL" if symbol == "SSLT"
replace symbol = "ZEEL" if symbol == "ZEETELE"

* Save the cleaned data
save NIFTY_clean, replace 
```

# Core Analysis {.tabset .tabset-pills}

## Python

### Data Visualization

Firstly, take a look at the data. Take the stock "ADANIPORTS" as an example.

```{python visualization, echo=T, results='hide'}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Plotting package in python
names = df1['Symbol'].cat.categories
example = df1[df1['Symbol'] == names[0]]
fig, ax = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(8, 8))
ax[0].plot(example['Date'], example['VWAP'])
ax[0].set_xticks([])
ax[0].set_xlabel('Days')
ax[0].set_ylabel('Volume weighted average price')
ax[1].plot(example['Date'], example['Volume'])
ax[1].set_xticks([])
ax[1].set_xlabel('Days')
ax[1].set_ylabel('Volume')
ax[2].plot(example['Date'], example['Turnover'])
ax[2].set_xticks([])
ax[2].set_xlabel('Days')
ax[2].set_ylabel('Turnover')
ax[0].set_title('Time series plots of stock %s' % names[0])
```

<center>**Figure 1.1**. Time series plots of ADANIPORTS</center>

### Determine Model Parameters

Python tutorial will use the time series VWAP for the analysis below.

The differencing parameter \(d\) of the model can be determined by doing
Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests, which can indicate whether the time series
are stationary. See the reference for more details about ADF tests. The
python packages `statsmodels.tsa` and `pmdarima.arima` are very helpful
here.

```{python determine_d}
from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA 
from pmdarima.arima.utils import ndiffs # ARIMA model packages
# This function chooses the smallest d for the series to be stationary
names = df1['Symbol'].cat.categories
ls0 = []
for i in names:
    subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == i]
    # Select the rows for stock i
    ls0.append(ndiffs(subdf['VWAP'], test='adf'))
ls0  # Most values are 1
max(ls0) 
```

Notice that we don't need 2-order differencing. In order to ensure all time
series are stationary, we choose \(d=1\) for all stocks.

The AR parameter \(p\) of the model can be determined by looking at Partial
Autocorrelation plots. These plots indicate the correlation between the series
and its lag. We use the first 4 stocks alphabetically as a sample. Notice the
series need to be differenced first (\(d=1\)).

```{python determine_p}
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 4, figsize=(15, 5))
# Take the first 4 stocks as a sample
for i in range(4):
    subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == names[i]]
    # Select the rows for stock number i
    plot_pacf(subdf['VWAP'].diff().dropna(), ax=ax[i])
    ax[i].set_title('PACF plot for stock %s' % names[i])
```

<center>**Figure 1.2**. PACF plots for choosing p</center>

Notice lag 1 is at least borderline significant in the plots for all stocks,
but lag 2 is not significant. Therefore, we can choose \(p=1\) for all stocks.

The MA parameter \(q\) of the model can be determined by looking at
Autocorrelation (ACF) plots. We use the next 4 stocks alphabetically as a 
sample. Similarly, the series need to be differenced (\(d=1\)).

```{python determine_q}
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 4, figsize=(15, 5))
for i in range(4):
    subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == names[i+4]]
    plot_acf(subdf['VWAP'].diff().dropna(), ax=ax[i])
    ax[i].set_title('ACF plot for stock %s' % names[i+4])
```

<center>**Figure 1.3**. ACF plots for choosing q</center>

Notice lag 1 is significant for most of the stocks but lag 2 is not. Therefore
we can choose \(q=1\) for the MA term.

### Fit Models

According to the process above, we choose the \(ARIMA(1, 1, 1)\) for all
stocks. After fitting the models, we can view some of the summaries. Take the
first 5 stocks alphabetically as an example.

```{python fitmodels111}
mlist = [] # Models
flist = [] # Model fits
for i in names:
    subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == i]
    m = ARIMA(list(subdf['VWAP']), order=(1, 1, 1))
    mlist.append(m)
    flist.append(m.fit(disp=0))
for i in range(5):
    print(flist[i].summary())
```

Notice that for the first 3 stocks, the model fit is not good. We can consider
removing the MA term since it's non-significant for some stocks, i.e. choosing
the \(ARIMA(1, 1, 0)\) model.

```{python fitmodels110}
mlist0 = [] # Models
flist0 = [] # Model fits
for i in names:
    subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == i]
    m = ARIMA(list(subdf['VWAP']), order=(1, 1, 0))
    mlist0.append(m)
    flist0.append(m.fit(disp=0))
```

We use AIC has the model choosing criteria. The AIC decreases for the first
three stocks, and increases for the 4th and 5th, indicating different stocks
need different models.

```{python choose_model}
includema = [] # Whether MA term should be included
for i in range(50):
    includema.append(flist0[i].aic > flist[i].aic)
pd.value_counts(includema)
```

### Model Diagnostics

Firstly, we can use the in-sample lagged values to predict the time series.
We can plot the prediction results for the first 5 stocks.

```{python in_sample_pred}
fig, ax = plt.subplots(5, figsize=(15, 20))
for i in range(5):
    if(includema): # ARIMA(1,1,1)
        flist[i].plot_predict(dynamic=False, ax=ax[i])
    else: # ARIMA(1,1,0)
        flist0[i].plot_predict(dynamic=False, ax=ax[i])
    ax[i].set_title(names[i])
fig.tight_layout()
fig
```

<center>**Figure 1.4**. Prediction plots</center>

We can also forecast future VWAPs using the chosen models. For example, we
can forecast the average prices in the next 200 trading days after the time
series.

```{python forecast, echo = T, results = 'hide'}
fig, ax = plt.subplots(5, figsize=(15, 20))
for i in range(5):
    if(includema):
        forecast, b, ci = flist[i].forecast(200, alpha=0.05)
    else:
        forecast, b, ci = flist0[i].forecast(200, alpha=0.05)
    subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == names[i]]
    ax[i].plot(list(subdf['VWAP']))
    idx = range(len(subdf['VWAP']), 200+len(subdf['VWAP']))
    ax[i].plot(idx, forecast)
    ax[i].fill_between(idx, ci[:, 0], ci[:, 1], 
                 alpha=0.15)
    ax[i].set_title(names[i])
    ax[i].set_xticks([])
fig.tight_layout()
```

```{python forecast_results}
fig
```

<center>**Figure 1.5**. Forecast plots</center>

Notice the confidence intervals are very wide, indicating it's not easy to
forecast stock prices.

### Model Improvement

Now that we chose different models for different stocks, we can further
improve the models by choosing the most proper model for each stock.

We can use <code>auto_arima</code> to choose models. It compares different
models and chooses the best one. Again, we use ADF test to determine \(d\),
and AIC to determine \(p,q\). Take "ADANIPORTS", "ASIANPAINT" and "BPCL" as
examples.

```{python improvements}
import pmdarima as paim
subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == names[0]]
m1 = paim.auto_arima(subdf['VWAP'], start_p=1, start_q=1, test='adf',
                     max_p=3, max_q=3)
m1.summary() # The chosen model was ARIMA(1, 0, 1), which is a good fit.
ls0[0] # Indeed, differencing is not needed for the stock 'ADANIPORTS'.
subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == names[1]]
m2 = paim.auto_arima(subdf['VWAP'], start_p=1, start_q=1, test='adf',
                     max_p=3, max_q=3)
m2.summary() # The chosen model was ARIMA(0, 1, 0), which is a good fit.
# For 'ASIANPAINT', the 1-order difference series is close to a constant.
subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == names[7]]
m3 = paim.auto_arima(subdf['VWAP'], start_p=1, start_q=1, test='adf',
                     max_p=3, max_q=3, error_action='ignore')
m3.summary() # The chosen model was ARIMA(1, 1, 2), which is a good fit.
# For 'BPCL' second order MA term is needed.
```

We can improve each of the models invidivually for slightly better
forecast performance.

## R

### Data Visualization

```{r load_packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# This block loads R packages that may be needed for the analysis.
library(dplyr, quietly = TRUE)
library(ggplot2, quietly = TRUE)
library(gridExtra, quietly = TRUE)
library(forecast, quietly = TRUE)
```

```{r trend, fig.cap = fig.cap1, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6.8}
fig.cap1 = "**Figure 2.1.** *Daily trend of all stocks, 2000-2020.*"
# plot trend of all stocks
nifty_ts = reshape2::melt(nifty_clean[, -c(2)], id.vars = "Date")
ggplot(nifty_ts, aes(x = Date, y = value)) + 
    geom_line(color= "deepskyblue4") + 
    theme_bw() +
    facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1)
```

From the trend of all stocks, we can see the time series of  exhibit 
non-stationarity. There was a substantial strike to the India stock market 
after the outbreak of Coronavirus.

### Determine Model Parameters 

R tutorial will focus on the variables: `Symbol`, `VWAP`, `Volume`, `Trades` 
and a newly created variable `Return`, which is the difference between `Close` 
and `Prev Close`.. First we choose one stock "ADANIPORTS" to 
analyze its ACF/PACF of trend on the above four variables. Normally, the 
choice of p and q in ARIMA(p, d, q) depends on ACF/PACF plots. The trend plot 
above shows huge volatility in `VWAP`, `Volume`, and `Turnover`, thus we can 
take log transformation to decrease its trend. The function for generation of 
ACF/PACF plots are `ggAcf()` and `ggPacf()` both under `forescast` 
package. You can choose to use `plot.acf()` under S3 method.


```{r acf, fig.cap = fig.cap2}
fig.cap2 = "**Figure 2.2.** *ACF plots for stock: ADANIPORTS.*"

candidate = "ADANIPORTS"
vars_list = c("VWAP", "Volume", "Turnover", "Return")

nifty_cand = nifty_clean %>% 
  filter(Symbol == candidate) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(matches(c("VWAP", "Volume", "Turnover"))), log)

# plot ACF
acf_list = vector(mode = "list", length = length(vars_list))
names(acf_list) = vars_list
for ( var in vars_list ) {
  acf_list[[var]] = forecast::ggAcf(nifty_cand[[var]], lag.max = 60) + 
    ggtitle(var) + 
    theme_bw()
}

do.call("grid.arrange", c(acf_list, ncol = 2))

```

Notice that all the variables show high autocorrelation except for `Return`, 
which is because `Return` is calculated from the first difference of closing 
price working as a linear filter applied to eliminate a trend. Since we are 
going to apply ARIMA model to the data, which can only works for stationary 
time series, let's take first difference of other three variables 
and compare the autocorrelation plot to the previous one. Later, we will apply
`auto.arima()` function in R, which works for non-stationary time series by
apply appropriate times of difference to detrend data.

```{r , echo=FALSE}
acf_diff_list = vector(mode = "list", length = length(vars_list))
names(acf_diff_list) = vars_list
for ( var in vars_list ) {
  if (var != "Return"){
    acf_diff_list[[var]] = 
      forecast::ggAcf(diff(nifty_cand[[var]]), lag.max = 60) + 
      ggtitle(var) + 
      theme_bw()
  } else {
    acf_diff_list[[var]] = 
      forecast::ggAcf(nifty_cand[[var]], lag.max = 60) + 
      ggtitle(var) + 
      theme_bw()
  }
}

pacf_list = vector(mode = "list", length = length(vars_list))
names(pacf_list) = vars_list
for ( var in vars_list ) {
  if (var != "Return"){
    pacf_list[[var]] = 
      forecast::ggPacf(diff(nifty_cand[[var]]), lag.max = 60) + 
      ggtitle(var) + 
      theme_bw()
  } else {
    pacf_list[[var]] = 
      forecast::ggPacf(nifty_cand[[var]], lag.max = 60) + 
      ggtitle(var) + 
      theme_bw()
  }
}

```


```{r acf2, fig.cap = fig.cap3}
fig.cap3 = paste("**Figure 2.3.** *ACF plots for stock: ADANIPORTS.*",
                 "VWAP, Volume, and Trades have taken first difference.")
do.call("grid.arrange", c(acf_diff_list, ncol = 2))
```

```{r pacf, fig.cap = fig.cap4}
fig.cap4 = paste("**Figure 2.4.** *PACF plots for stock: ADANIPORTS.*",
                 "VWAP, Volume, and Trades have taken first difference.")

do.call("grid.arrange", c(pacf_list, ncol = 2))
```

By looking at the ACF/PACF you can have a general idea which p and q value to 
choose. Take `VWAP` for example, both plots show the high ACF and PACF end
on the second lag, suggesting that ARIMA(2, 1, 2) might be suitable for 
`VWAP`. However, the general eye bowling is not that precise and for variable
like `Return` it is tricky to find p and q by ACF/PACF plots. As a result,
we can use AIC as criteria to choose p and q.

### Fit Models

Let’s tabulate some AIC values for a range of different choices of p and q, 
assuming d takes 0 for `Return` while 1 for other 3 variables. We will 
subset the last 120 time series as test data. Below shows the AIC table of 
fitting ARIMA on `Return` time series of stock: "ADANIPORTS".
 
```{r aic, warning = FALSE}
aic_table = function(ts, P, Q, d){ 
  table = matrix(NA, (P + 1), (Q + 1)) 
  for(p in 0:P) { 
    for(q in 0:Q) { 
      table[p + 1, q + 1] <- arima(ts, order=c(p, d, q))$aic
    } 
  }
  dimnames(table) = list(paste("AR", 0:P, sep = ""), 
                          paste("MA", 0:Q, sep = ""))
  table
}

# Construct AIC table
nifty_cand_ts = ts(nifty_cand$Return, frequency = 1, start = c(2000, 01, 03))
nifty_aic_table = aic_table(head(nifty_cand_ts, -30), 4, 4, 0) 

tab.cap2 = '**Table 2**. *AIC for different ARIMA parameters*'
nifty_aic_table %>%
  knitr::kable(format = 'html', caption = tab.cap2) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling('striped', full_width = TRUE) 


```

The AIC table suggests that ARIMA(4, 0, 3) with the smallest AIC
is the best model for the return of "ADANIPORTS". This model may imply
that increasing p and q will tend to get smaller AIC for a better 
fit. However, models with higher p and q are more complex, so it may 
lead to problems like overfitting, numerical stability and etc. We usually 
prefer a simply model, which also better for interpretation.

Even though it is nice to view the change of AIC value as the change of 
p and q, for a big data set like this, it is very inefficient to iterate over 
range of p and q. `auto.arima()`in the `forest` package is much faster in 
generating the results. It uses variant of Hyndman-Khandakar algorithm, 
which combines unit root test, minimizing AICc and MLE, and etc as evaluation 
criteria. `auto.arima()` on the training dataset for which the order specified 
is (4, 0, 2).

```{r , warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ts_arima = auto.arima(head(nifty_cand_ts, -30), max.p = 4, 
                      max.q = 4, max.d = 3)
print(ts_arima)
```

The return equation can be written as: 
$$X_t = 1.475 X_{t-1}-0.757X_{t-2}+0.002X_{t-3}+0.014X_{t-4}
-1.477\varepsilon_{t-1}+0.766\varepsilon_{t-2}$$

### Model Diagnosis

Lastly, we will test our model by forecasting the next 120 time series 
and compare the result with our test set.

```{r acc}
ts_forecasts = forecast(ts_arima, h = 30) 
acc = accuracy(ts_forecasts, head(tail(nifty_cand_ts, 30), 7))
print(round(acc, 4))
```
The RMSE and MAE for the test set are 19.0664 and 6.8923, respectively. 
Furthermore, we could plot the residual plot of our forecast.

```{r forc_fig, fig.cap = fig.cap4, fig.height = 3.1}
fig.cap4 = "**Figure 2.5.** *Residual Diagnosis*"

p1 = autoplot(ts_forecasts, main = "") + xlab("Day") + 
  ggtitle("Residuals of Forecast") +
  ylab("Return") +
  theme_bw()
p2 = ggAcf(resid(ts_arima)) + ggtitle("ACF of residuals") +
  theme_bw()

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

Unfortunately, the residual plot does not appear normal. It suggests the 
result is heavily tailed. As the ARIMA model that we applied takes the MLE 
approach with moment assumptions, our data clearly do not hold the Gaussian 
distribution. ACF of residuals indicates that there is correlation in 
the residuals series. Thus, our model fails to account for all 
available information.

One way to imprve the model is to take log-transform of the data. A second 
way is to apply the ARIMA model that fits t-distributed errors without 
assuming Gaussian white noise. A third way is to use data segmentation 
that takes interventions into consideration, as stock data is often 
affected by government policy.

### Model Improvement

Let's try to take log transformation for `Close` and `Prev Close` prior to
calculating the `Return`.

```{r arima_log}

nifty_cand = nifty %>% 
  filter(Symbol == candidate) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(matches(c("Close", "Prev Close"))), log) %>% 
  mutate(Return = Close - `Prev Close`)

nifty_cand_ts = ts(nifty_cand$Return, frequency = 1, start = c(2000, 01, 03))

ts_log_arima = auto.arima(head(nifty_cand_ts, -30), max.p = 4, 
                      max.q = 4, max.d = 3)

print(ts_log_arima)
```

`auto.arima()` suggests ARIMA(1, 0, 1) is the best fit for log returns.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
p1 = autoplot(resid(ts_log_arima)) + xlab("Day") + ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Residuals from ARIMA(1, 0, 0)") + theme_bw()
p2 = ggAcf(resid(ts_log_arima)) + ggtitle("ACF of residuals") +
  theme_bw()

```
  
```{r resid_log, fig.height = 3.1, fig.cap = fig.cap6}
fig.cap6 = "**Figure 2.6.** *Residual Diagnosis of log returns.*"

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

We can see after taken the log transformation, there seems no significant 
correlation in the residuals series and variation of residuals stays very much
the same apart from two outliers. Consequently, We can now be confident 
about model forecasts, which appears to account for all available information,
but prediction intervals that are computed assuming a normal distribution 
may still be inaccurate.

## Stata

### Data Visualization

We visualize the data and the stock "ADANIPORTS" is taken as an example.

```{stata visualization_stata, eval=FALSE}
use NIFTY_clean, clear

keep if symbol == "ADANIPORTS"

graph twoway line vwap date, color("blue") xtitle("Days") ///
ytitle("Volume weighted average price")
graph export vwap_date.png, replace
graph twoway line volume date, color("blue") xtitle("Days") ytitle("Volume")
graph export volume_date.png, replace
graph twoway line turnover date, color("blue") xtitle("Days") ytitle("Turnover")
graph export turnover_date.png, replace
```

<center>
![VWAP](./Stata/vwap_date.png){width=300px}

![Volume](./Stata/volume_date.png){width=300px}

![Turnover](./Stata/turnover_date.png){width=300px}

### Determine Model Parameters

We will use the time series VWAP for the analysis below.

For all stocks, we do Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests to determine whether the
time series are stationary or not.

```{stata ADFtest_stata, eval=FALSE}
use NIFTY_clean, clear

local sbls_f5 = "ADANIPORTS ASIANPAINT AXISBANK BAJAJ-AUTO BAJAJFINSV"

foreach sym of local sbls_f5 {
	use NIFTY_clean, clear
	keep if symbol == "`sym'"
	tsset date
	dfuller d1.vwap
}
```

We do the test on the <code>vwap</code> with the first-order differentiation.
All stocks are reporting minimum p-values, hence we decide to use \(d=1\) for 
all stocks.

Then, in order to find AR parameter \(p\) of the model, we generate the partial 
autoregressive (PACF) plots together with autoregressive (ACF) plots. Here, the 
parameter \(p\) represents the number of lags of this model. We only consider 
relationships for one variable and \(p\) variables beyond it. The MA parameter 
\(q\) has exactly the same meaning as AR models. 

Note: we will only plot the first 5 stocks as an example.

```{stata pacf_acf, eval=FALSE}
use NIFTY_clean, clear

foreach sym of local sbls_f5 {
	use NIFTY_clean, clear
	keep if symbol == "`sym'"
	tsset date
	ac vwap
	graph export acf_`sym'.png
	pac vwap
	graph export pacf_`sym'.png
}
```

The PACF plots for these stocks are the following:

<center>
![ADA](./Stata/acf&pacf/pacf_ADANIPORTS.png){width=300px}

![ASI](./Stata/acf&pacf/pacf_ASIANPAINT.png){width=300px}

![AXI](./Stata/acf&pacf/pacf_AXISBANK.png){width=300px}

![BAJA](./Stata/acf&pacf/pacf_BAJAJ-AUTO.png){width=300px}

![BAJF](./Stata/acf&pacf/pacf_BAJAJFINSV.png){width=300px}

**Figure 3.2**. PACF plots
</center>

And the ACF plots for the these 5 stocks are the following:

<center>
![ADA](./Stata/acf&pacf/acf_ADANIPORTS.png){width=300px}

![ASI](./Stata/acf&pacf/acf_ASIANPAINT.png){width=300px}

![AXI](./Stata/acf&pacf/acf_AXISBANK.png){width=300px}

![BAJA](./Stata/acf&pacf/acf_BAJAJ-AUTO.png){width=300px}

![BAJF](./Stata/acf&pacf/acf_BAJAJFINSV.png){width=300px}

**Figure 3.3**. ACF plots
</center>

We can get the similar conclusion that lag 1 is absolutely significant while lag
2 is not, hencewe can choose \(p=1\) for the AR term and \(q=1\) for the MA 
term for all stocks.

### Fit Models

According to the process above, we choose the \(ARIMA(1, 1, 1)\) (where the 
first parameter is \(p\) , the second is \(d\) and the third is \(p\)) for all
stocks. However, diagnostics tells sometimes the \(ARIMA(1, 1, 0)\) performs
better for some stocks. Hence, we try to use the better model to fit the data 
and then plot the predicted values against original values.

Note: we will only plot the first 5 stocks as an example.

```{stata fitting, eval=FALSE}
use NIFTY_clean, clear

local sbls_f5 = "ADANIPORTS ASIANPAINT AXISBANK BAJAJ-AUTO BAJAJFINSV"

foreach sym of local sbls_f5 {
	use NIFTY_clean, clear
	keep if symbol == "`sym'"
	tsset date
	arima vwap, arima(1,1,1)
	estat ic
	mat l_aim = r(S)
	scalar aic_aim = l_aim[1,5]
	arima vwap, arima(1,1,0)
	estat ic
	mat l_ai = r(S)
	scalar aic_ai = l_aim[1,5]
	if aic_aim > aic_ai {
		tsappend, add(200)
		arima vwap, arima(1,1,0)
		predict vwap_pd
		gen vwap_p = vwap_pd + vwap
		replace vwap_p=vwap_p[_n-1]+ vwap_pd[_n] if _n > _N - 200
		graph twoway line vwap date, lwidth("vthin") color("blue") || line ///
		vwap_p date, lwidth("vthin") color("red") lpattern("dash")
		graph export fitted_`sym'.png, replace
	} 
	else {
		tsappend, add(200)
		arima vwap, arima(1,1,1)
		predict vwap_pd
		gen vwap_p = vwap_pd + vwap
		replace vwap_p=vwap_p[_n-1]+ vwap_pd[_n] if _n > _N - 200
		graph twoway line vwap date, lwidth("vthin") color("blue") || line ///
		vwap_p date, lwidth("vthin") color("red") lpattern("dash")
		graph export fitted_`sym'.png, replace
	}
}
```

The regression coefficient is the following:

Also, the out-of-sample prediction is implemented here. we tried to predict the 
tendency of the stoch price in next 200 trading days and he sample fitted graphs
are:

### Model Improvement

Now that we chose different models for different stocks, we can further
improve the models by choosing the most proper model for each stock.

However, Stata does not have some similar funciton as <code>auto_arima</code> 
to choose models automatically. Hence, we may related to other two languages (
Python, R). Heavy and tedious computation is expected in Stata here.

# Conclusion

ARIMA model is an useful tool to model time series data. It can help us
understand the data better and predict future trends. For example, stock
prices data can be modeled using ARIMA models. Choosing proper model
parameters is important to improve the forecasting accuracy.

In this tutorial, we covered applying ARIMA model to forecasting 
stock related variables using Python, R and Stata. We also cross validated 
our results with actual data and suggested a model improvement method. Even 
though we followed along the same time analysis procedure with ARIMA modeling, 
we show different angles of tackling the problem. Among all three programming 
language, Python and R are very powerful to model time series data with 
implemented `auto_arima()` / `auto.arima()` functions which selects appropriate
values for p, d and q automatically. For Stata, determination of
parameters is mostly based on looking at ACF/PACF plots with trial and error.
However, we should not blindly rely on automatic procedures. It is 
worthwhile to know how changing p, d and q affects the long-term forecasts as 
well as prediction intervals.

All 3 languages can produce plots visualizing the results fairly easily. But
compared to Python and R, it's fairly hard to output results in Stata. The
advantage of Stata is that it has simpler syntax and it's easy to understand
the code.
